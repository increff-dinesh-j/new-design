# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Multi-Tab Interface

## 1. Product Overview

**Feature Name:** Multi-Tab Data Interface

**Description:** An intuitive web-based multi-tab interface that enables business analysts to switch between different datasets seamlessly.

**Target Users:** Business Analysts

**Business Objectives:** To improve user efficiency, streamline data analysis, and enhance user experience by providing seamless navigation between different datasets.

## 2. User Stories & Use Cases

**User Story 1:** As a business analyst, I want to switch between different tabs so that I can view various datasets related to different workflow steps.

**Use Case 1:** User logs into the application, selects a tab from the multi-tab interface, views the data, and switches to another tab to view a different dataset.

**User Story 2:** As a business analyst, I want to interact with data within each tab so that I can filter data and drill-down into charts.

**Use Case 2:** User selects a tab, uses the filter options to refine the data, hovers over a chart to view more details, and clicks on a chart segment to drill-down into the data.

## 3. Functional Requirements

1. The multi-tab interface should display tabs ordered by workflow steps.
2. Each tab should contain a different dataset.
3. Users should be able to switch between tabs by clicking on them.
4. Users should be able to filter data within each tab.
5. Users should be able to interact with charts via hover or drill-down.
6. The interface should auto-refresh data in real time, preserving applied filters and selections.
7. The interface should be responsive and adapt to different device sizes.
8. The interface should handle errors gracefully, showing a clear error message with a retry option.

## 4. User Interface Specifications

### Screen-by-screen breakdown with layouts

#### Screen 1: Multi-Tab Interface
- The top of the screen should display the multi-tab interface. Each tab should represent a different dataset related to a workflow step.
- The active tab should be highlighted.
- The rest of the screen should display the data within the active tab, following a grid layout.

#### Screen 2: Tab Data Layout
- Each tab should start with a summary header.
- Key charts should be displayed at the top.
- Detailed tables should be displayed below the charts.
- Filter options should be aligned on the side.

### Component specifications and placement
- Tabs: Placed horizontally at the top of the screen.
- Summary header: Placed at the top of each tab content.
- Charts: Placed below the summary header in each tab.
- Tables: Placed below the charts in each tab.
- Filters: Aligned on the side of each tab content.

### User flow diagrams and navigation paths
- User logs into the application -> Selects a tab from the multi-tab interface -> Views the data within the tab -> Switches to another tab -> Views the data within the new tab.

### Responsive design requirements
- On larger screens, tabs should be displayed horizontally at the top of the screen.
- On smaller screens, tabs should collapse into a dropdown or swipeable view.

### Accessibility standards and guidelines
- All elements should be accessible and navigable via keyboard.
- All images and charts should have alt text for screen readers.
- Color contrast should meet WCAG 2.1 level AA standards.

## 5. User Experience Requirements

### Interaction patterns and behaviors
- Clicking on a tab should switch to that tab and load its data.
- Hovering over a chart should display more details.
- Clicking on a chart segment should drill-down into the data.

### Form validation and error handling
- Any filters applied should validate input and provide feedback on errors.
- If data fails to load, an error message should be displayed with a retry option.

### Loading states and feedback mechanisms
- While data is loading, a loading spinner should be displayed.
- After a successful data load, the data should be displayed.
- After a failed data load, an error message should be displayed.

### Animation and transition specifications
- Transitions between tabs should be smooth, with a brief fade or slide animation.

### User feedback and confirmation flows
- After applying a filter, a confirmation message should be displayed.
- After a successful data refresh, a confirmation message should be displayed.

## 6. Data Handling & State Management
- Data flow: Data should flow from the server to the UI, with changes pushed in real time.
- State persistence: Each tab's filters and scroll position should be preserved when switching tabs.
- Real-time synchronization: The interface should auto-refresh data in real time.
- Caching: Data should be cached to improve performance and handle connectivity issues.

## 7. Error Handling & Edge Cases
- Error scenarios: Data fails to load, loss of connectivity.
- User feedback: Display a clear error banner with retry and offline indicators.
- Edge case handling: Keep the UI layout intact and cached data visible when errors occur.
- Fallback behaviors: If data fails to load after retrying, display an offline indicator and the last cached data.

## 8. Technical Requirements
- Performance: The interface should load quickly and respond to user interactions without delay.
- Scalability: The design should handle an increasing number of tabs and data.
- Security: Data should be encrypted in transit and at rest.

## 9. Data Requirements
- Data models: Each tab should have a corresponding data model with fields for the summary, charts, and tables.
- Storage: Data should be stored in a secure, scalable database.
- API specifications: The interface should use RESTful APIs to fetch and update data.

## 10. Integration Requirements
- The interface should integrate with the existing data analysis platform and authentication system.

## 11. Success Metrics
- User efficiency: Reduction in time taken to switch between datasets.
- User satisfaction: Increase in user satisfaction scores in feedback surveys.
- Error rates: Reduction in data load failures.

## 12. Acceptance Criteria
- The multi-tab interface displays tabs ordered by workflow steps.
- Users can switch between tabs by clicking on them.
- Users can filter data within each tab.
- The interface auto-refreshes data in real time, preserving applied filters and selections.
- The interface is responsive and adapts to different device sizes.
- The interface handles errors gracefully, showing a clear error message with a retry option.

## 13. Implementation Phases
1. Design the multi-tab interface and data layout within each tab.
2. Develop the multi-tab interface and data fetching functionality.
3. Implement the data interaction features, like filters and drill-down.
4. Develop the responsive design and error handling features.
5. Test the interface and fix any issues.
6. Deploy the interface to production.

## 14. Risk Assessment
- Potential challenges: Complex data models, real-time data updates, responsive design.
- Mitigation strategies: Use proven design patterns, leverage existing libraries and tools, conduct rigorous testing.
